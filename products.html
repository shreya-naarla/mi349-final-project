              <h2>&nbsp;&nbsp;Puppy Product Checklist</h2>
              <ul>
              	<li><strong>Collar</strong>
              	  <ul>
                  	<li>
                  	Puppies will quickly outgrow their first collar, but that doesn't mean that picking the first collar isn't important! Collars should have ID tags with your pup's name and your phone number in case your puppy gets lost.
                    </li>
              	  </ul>
                </li>
              	<li><strong>Leash</strong>
              	  <ul>
                  	<li>
                  	A standard nylon or leather leash is the best option for your puppy, as it will provide the best tool to teach loose leash walking.
                  	</li>
              	  </ul>
                </li>
              	<li><strong>Crate</strong>
              	  <ul>
                  	<li>
                  	It's up to you to decide if you will crate your dog. Crates should be large enough for your dog to sit, turn around and lay down comfortably. Some crates offer the option to start off smaller with inserts, so your crate size can grow as your puppy does. You don't want a crate that is too big for your puppy, as this will allow him to use the extra space as his toilet. A proper sized crate is a helpful tool for house-training and can also help prevent anxiety by establishing your dog's personal safe space.
                  	</li>
              	  </ul>
                </li>
              	<li><strong>Bed</strong>
              	  <ul>
                  	<li>
                  	There are thousands of options when it comes to dog beds, but your puppy only really cares that his bed is soft and clean. Towels, blankets or fancy plush dog beds are all acceptable to your pup! Ensure whatever you choose is easily washed, as potty accidents are bound to happen when your puppy first comes home.
                  	</li>
              	  </ul>
                </li>
              	<li><strong>Dog Food</strong>
              	  <ul>
                  	<li>
                  	Puppies have a lot of growing to do, so providing them with proper nutrition is extremely important. Ask your breeder and/or veterinarian their opinions on what brand and type of dog food best fits your puppy at this stage of life.
                  	</li>
              	  </ul>
                </li>
              	<li><strong>Treats</strong>
                	<ul>
                  	<li>
                  	With all the training you'll be doing, it's important to have treats on hand! Treats are a great form of positive reinforcement that can help keep your puppy interested during a training session. Make sure treats are easy for puppies to chew, healthy and fed in moderation.
                  	</li>
              	  </ul>
                </li>
              	<li><strong>Toys</strong>
              	  <ul>
                  	<li>
                  	Puppies need toys and lots of them! Teething toys help puppies focus their need to chew into an appropriate outlet. Toys should be durable and made with puppy-safe materials that they can't destroy. Puppies should be supervised when playing with toys to avoid ingestion of small broken off pieces. Interactive puzzle toys are also available to stimulate your puppy's brain and keep him busy longer!
                  	</li>
              	  </ul>
                </li>
              	<li><strong>Dog Shampoo</strong>
              	  <ul>
                  	<li>
                  	Puppies like to get dirty, which means lots of baths! Have puppy-safe shampoo on hand to help remove dirt and grime. Dog brushes and nail clippers are also important tools for dog grooming.
                  	</li>
              	  </ul>
                </li>
              	<li><strong>Food and Water Bowls</strong>
              	  <ul>
                  	<li>
                  	Bowls can be made of ceramic, plastic or stainless steel and should be the correct size for your puppy.
                  	</li>
              	  </ul>
                </li>
