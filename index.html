              <h1 style="text-align:left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;Why You Should Adopt A Dog</h1>
              <p style="margin:20px; ">It truly is impossible to imagine a world where dogs never existed. Owning a dog is just such a privilege that a majority of families own a dog, or have owned a dog at some point of time in their lives. The level of intelligence is simply leaps and bounds beyond any other pet you could ever think of. They are always loyal, protective, and caring to their owners. There is simply an unbreakable bond between a dog and its owner, which is like having a brother or sister, a daughter or son, or just the best friend of your life. Its simply astounding that there is such a strong connection between dogs and humans, yet their lives are so short in comparison and range between 10-15 years in length. Of course there are always exceptions to this time span, but the truth is that they never live with you forever and you have to cherish the time you have with them. There are now companies that have latched on to this emotional connection to dogs and can clone your pet so you can literally spend another dog lifespan with your favorite companion. Perhaps they are not the most unique animal in the world, but when it comes to the hobby of raising a dog from being a puppy to old age, there is no hobby more passionate that having a pet dog.</p>
